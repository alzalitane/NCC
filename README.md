## Introduction:
This project was to assist an online national clothing chain in creating a targeted marketing campaign aimed at re-engaging lost customers and boosting sales. With sales stagnating, the company sought to leverage data-driven insights to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations. Using Microsoft Power BI desktop application, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer, drawing insights from a variety of data sources including US Census Bureau statistics, business data, and customer data.

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project was to conduct an in-depth analysis to inform a targeted marketing campaign for the national clothing chain. Specifically, I aimed to:
Utilize population statistics from the US Census Bureau to identify areas with the highest income levels around the country and assess the correlation between sales and income.
Analyze inventory data, including customer ratings and return rates, to understand correlations and inform product selection for the marketing campaign.
Draw conclusions and provide actionable insights using visuals to address key analysis questions outlined in the project instructions.
Develop linear regression formulas to predict customer sales and incomes based on purchase history and location data.
Predict the customer with the highest income and determine which product will be advertised the most based on the analysis results.

## Scenario:
As a data analyst I was tasked with revitalizing the sales performance of a struggling online national clothing chain. With sales flatlining, the company is eager to implement a targeted marketing campaign to lure back lost customers. The challenge lies in identifying the right products to advertise to each customer segment based on their demographics, purchase history, and location.
To tackle this challenge, I leveraged Microsoft Power BI to analyze a wealth of data from various sources, including the US Census Bureau, business data, and customer data. By correlating sales with income levels across different regions, I aimed to identify lucrative markets for targeted advertising campaigns. Additionally, I delved into inventory data to assess the relationship between customer ratings, return rates, and product popularity.
Drawing conclusions from the analysis, I addressed key questions such as the correlation between sales and income, the relationship between customer ratings and product return rates, and the prediction of customer sales and incomes through linear regression modeling. Furthermore, I identified the customer with the highest predicted income and determined the most suitable product to advertise to each customer segment based on their preferences and demographics.
By providing actionable insights derived from data-driven analysis, my goal was to equip the national clothing chain with the knowledge and strategies needed to revitalize sales and regain lost customers, ultimately driving growth and success in the competitive retail market.
